# GLEngine

GLEngine is an OpenGL graphics engine written in an object-oriented C styling (Not an object oriented version of C, just C written with an object oriented mindset). It utilizes the GLFW 3 library for creating the window and GL context. The intent is for this to be written in a very lightweight, easy to use, but feature defficient manner so beginners to OpenGL can understand what's going on.

### Currently Supports

  - Windows 7, 8, 10
  - Mac 10.7+
  - Ubuntu 17.10 (Tested only on Wayland environment)

### Required tools

  - GLFW 3 Development Library
  - Clang C Compiler (Likely works on GCC but not tested)
  - GNU Make Utility
  - Appropriate OpenGL Libraries For Your Platform
